Title: $\mathrm{EHP}$ sequences, exponents of homotopy groups and the Barratt conjecture  

Abstract: This is an introductory talk on the Barratt conjecture. The lecture will start from classical $EHP$ sequences. Then we move to talk about some recent research on generalized $EHP$ fibrations as well as some open questions on spherical fibrations over spheres. After showing that the $2$-torsion component of $\pi_*(S^3)$ has an exponent of $4$ as an introductory example, we highlight some classical results on the exponents of homotopy groups. Finally we will talk the Barratt Conjecture, which is a longstanding open problem, as well as the proposed approaches for attacking the conjecture.

Title: Topics on hyperplane arrangements

Abstract: In these talks, we survey the theory of hyperplane arrangements and its variants. Our goal is to give an introduction to some open problems in this field, especially those related to topology.

Title: SOME NOTES ON REALIZING SPACES AS CLASSIFYING
SPACES

Abstract: The Dold-Lashof classifying space, $Baut_1 (X)$, is the classifying space for fibrations with fibre the homotopy type of $X$. There is a long-standing, open question in rational homotopy theory: 
Which simply connected rational homotopy types occur as $Baut_1(X)$? In this present, we will show the following unrealization result: 
The rational homotopy type of $CP^3$ is not realized as the classifying space of any simply connected, π-finite, rational space.
