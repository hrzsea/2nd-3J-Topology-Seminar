Title: $\mathrm{EHP}$ sequences, exponents of homotopy groups and the Barratt conjecture  

Abstract: This is an introductory talk on the Barratt conjecture. The lecture will start from classical $EHP$ sequences. Then we move to talk about some recent research on generalized $EHP$ fibrations as well as some open questions on spherical fibrations over spheres. After showing that the $2$-torsion component of $\pi_*(S^3)$ has an exponent of $4$ as an introductory example, we highlight some classical results on the exponents of homotopy groups. Finally we will talk the Barratt Conjecture, which is a longstanding open problem, as well as the proposed approaches for attacking the conjecture.

Title: Topics on hyperplane arrangements

Abstract: In these talks, we survey the theory of hyperplane arrangements and its variants. Our goal is to give an introduction to some open problems in this field, especially those related to topology.

Title: On the Covering Type

Abstract: The covering type of a space X is a numerical homotopy invariant, which in some sense measures the homotopical size of X. In this talk，I'll give a brief introduction of covering type.

Title: Finiteness and infiniteness of the Torelli groups of (hyper)-Kahler manifolds (2)  

Abstract: The Torelli group of a closed smooth manifold X is the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of elements which act trivially on the integral cohomology of X. In this note we give counterexamples to a theorem by Verbitsky which states that the Torelli group of simply connected Kahler manifolds of complex dimension >2 is finite. We also give a counterexample to the theorem of Verbitsky which claims that the Torelli group of hyper-Kahler manifolds are finite. Finally we confirm the finiteness result for the special case of the hyper-Kahler manifold K[2]. This is a joint work with M.Kreck.

Title: Existence of contact structures on 9-manifolds

Abstract: In this talk, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed orientable 9-manifold to admit a contact structure will be given.
In addition, seems to be of independent interest, we will prove that the 7-th integral Stiefel-Whitney class of a 9-dimensional spinc manifold is zero. This is a joint work with Diarmuid Crowley.

Title: SOME NOTES ON REALIZING SPACES AS CLASSIFYING
SPACES

Abstract: The Dold-Lashof classifying space, $Baut_1 (X)$, is the classifying space for fibrations with fibre the homotopy type of $X$. There is a long-standing, open question in rational homotopy theory: 
Which simply connected rational homotopy types occur as $Baut_1(X)$? In this present, we will show the following unrealization result: 
The rational homotopy type of $CP^3$ is not realized as the classifying space of any simply connected, π-finite, rational space.
